# thinking-in-biological-systems
Computational tools for exploring dynamical regimes in biological systems using simulation and interpretable machine learning.
The focus is on:
- Simulating simplified biological processes
- Extracting interpretable features from time-series data
- Identifying and classifying dynamic regimes
- Connecting observed dynamics to underlying biological constraints

All examples use synthetic or public data and are intended to develop
transferable intuition relevant to neuroscience, genetics, protein
engineering, evolution, and automated experimentation.
